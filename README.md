3rd year Electrical Engineering student
## About Repo: 
This repo contains my attempts at the CP1404 practicals

## 3 things I have learnt about clean code:

- Global constants are a good tool to enable updates to happen easier in the future.
- Non abbreviated and meaningful variables are much easier to read and understand.
- Creating functions that only do one task makes keeping track of code less complicated and easier to debug.
